    <p>SUMMARY :</p>
    <p> Adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's popular children's novels about Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his
      eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his
      own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school
      for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about
      his
      parents' mysterious deaths.</p>
    <p>Massage by the Auther:</p>
    <p>Love is a strong theme throughout the books; if you love someone completely it can never be undone. Lily's love
      for
      Harry granted him protection and Snape's love for Lily shaped his path after her death. True love lasts forever.
